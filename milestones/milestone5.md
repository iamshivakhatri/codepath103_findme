## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 Throughout this unit, our group successfully implemented CRUD operations and connected the frontend actions to the API seamlessly. The collaborative effort in integrating data association and manipulation techniques to link destinations with trips was a notable achievement.]

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾  One of the challenges we faced was coordinating the frontend and backend development effectively. Ensuring smooth communication between different components posed some difficulties, but regular team meetings and clear communication channels helped overcome these challenges.]

### 3. What were some of the highlights or achievements that you are most proud of in this project?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 We take pride in successfully implementing stretch features such as allowing users to add photos and videos to trips, add comments, and search for trips by destination. These additions enhance the user experience and make our application more feature-rich.]

### 4. Reflecting on your web development journey so far, how have you grown since the beginning of the course?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 Since the beginning of the course, I have witnessed significant growth in my web development skills. From understanding the basics to implementing complex features, I've gained proficiency in technologies like React and asynchronous programming. This project has particularly strengthened my ability to handle both frontend and backend aspects of web development.]

### 5. Looking ahead, what are your goals related to web development, and what steps do you plan to take to achieve them?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 Moving forward, my goals in web development include diving deeper into advanced frameworks and exploring full-stack development. I plan to take on more challenging projects that involve real-world problem-solving. Additionally, participating in coding challenges and contributing to open-source projects will be crucial steps to enhance my skills and knowledge.]
