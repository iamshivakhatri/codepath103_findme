## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

During this unit, we successfully implemented several features in our project, including the ability to view and edit user profiles, add, edit, and delete projects, and a modal for editing bio information. The use of React components and state management helped organize our code efficiently. Collaboration within the team was effective, and we were able to address and resolve issues promptly.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
One challenge we encountered was integrating the modal functionality for editing bio information. Ensuring smooth communication between components and managing state transitions required careful consideration. Additionally, coordinating the styling across different components and ensuring a cohesive user interface presented some challenges.


### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?
We were able to complete most of the planned tasks in our sprint plan. However, due to unforeseen challenges, we couldn't implement all the desired styling features. To prioritize the remaining tasks, we would focus on resolving any critical bugs or functionality issues first and then allocate time to polish the user interface.


### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?
The styling and user interface improvements could be considered "at risk" due to time constraints. If these items remain at risk, we might consider simplifying the styling or focusing on the most critical aspects to meet the project's functional requirements.


### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
As we move forward, additional support in areas such as performance optimization, deployment strategies, and potential integration of new features would be valuable. Additionally, guidance on best practices for testing and debugging in a production environment would contribute to the project's overall success.
