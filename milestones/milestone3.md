## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We effectively organized our project management on GitHub and successfully created milestones and issues for our features.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Defining feature scope and task prioritization took some effort, and we needed to ensure clear issue documentation.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We completed all tasks for this unit. If not, we would prioritize tasks based on importance and dependencies.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

No features are at risk in this unit. We'd reassess priorities and potentially simplify or postpone less critical features if delays occur in the future.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We may need assistance with technical challenges or issues during development, so access to additional resources or support for problem-solving would be helpful.
